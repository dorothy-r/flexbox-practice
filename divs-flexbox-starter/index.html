                <p>I'm a mother of two young children, and I want them to see me thriving in a fulfilling career. I love how intellectually engaging coding is. And I also love that it offers so much freedom and flexibility. I'm excited about a career that requires a lifetime of learning.</p>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>I love music, but have fallen out of the habit of playing regularly, now that I am no longer practicing music therapy. One of my goals for next year is to get back into practicing piano and guitar regularly. Once it is safe to do so, I want to join a choir, and also learn to play the cello!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>Cooking and baking have become more important to me this year than ever before. My family and I are at home together all day long now, and I like learning how to make new foods for us. Since we rarely leave the house now, it's nice to have some variety at home.</p>
